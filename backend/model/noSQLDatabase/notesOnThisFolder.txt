To be implemented.

- To demonstrate the 'encapsulation' of the database implementation
by the 'databaseFactory' and 'interface classes', that is, the code does not depend
on the database, just on the classes and methods I defined, therefore I can change
the database and libraries associated with it freely.

- To demonstrate the usage of NoSQL db and associated libraries (probably going to 
be MongoDB and Mongoose)
